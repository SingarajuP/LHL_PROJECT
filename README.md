# Predicting Breast Cancer from tissue samples

This is a final Data Science project at Lighthouse labs

Overview:
The most common type of cancer is Breast cancer impacting 2.1 million women worldwide every year. About 80% of all breast cancers are invasive ductal carcinomas. Invasive means that the cancer has spread to the surrounding breast tissues. Over time, invasive ductal carcinoma can spread to the lymph nodes and possibly to other areas of the body.
Doctors prescribe biopsy after physical examination and the sample will be observed by pathologists under microscope. Depending on the size, color, texture and other things, the type of the cancer and the grade of the cancer is known. And the treatment will be based on this information.
The automatic detection of tumor cells will help pathologists save time by evaluating the results faster. 

Aim:
To build a classifier that identifies the breast cancer from the images of tissue samples
